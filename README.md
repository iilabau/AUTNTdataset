# AUTNTdataset

Aliah University Text Non-Text (AUTNT) dataset contains component level multi-script text non-text images. There are three-fold utilities of this dataset: (i) component level image classification, (ii) script identification, and (iii) character recognition. Ground truth data are also prepared and included in this repository. Component images are chosen from diverse sources and conditions to ensure unconstrained working environment and applicabilty in practical scenario. 

## Dataset Summary
Total number of component level images: 10771.
Text component images: 7890.
Non-text component images: 2881.
Dataset is divided into two category based on source images viz. complex documnet level text components and Scene level text components along with non-text components.
Dataset is divided into 5:1 ratio for training and test set. In the training set, 6314 text and 2305 non-text components along with ground truths are present.
In the test set, 1576 text and 576 non-text components along with ground truths are present.

Among all text components of the training set, 3264 components are taken from complex document images and the rest 3050 components are taken from natural indoor/outdoor sources. Dataset contains multi-script text components viz. Latin, Devanagari and Bengali. Components are scale invariant and multi oriented in nature.  Component images are having near-homogenous as well as complex background with uneven illumination effects.
